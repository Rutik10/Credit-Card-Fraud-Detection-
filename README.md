Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Weka

Proposal for Data Mining Project

Dataset DescripƟon:
The dataset that will be analyzed for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud DetecƟon" dataset, which can
be obtained from Kaggle at the following URL: hƩps://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. This
dataset contains credit card transacƟon data, where each transacƟon is labeled as fraudulent (class 1) or
non-fraudulent (class 0). It has a total of 284,807 transacƟons, out of which 492 (0.17%) are labeled as
fraud. The dataset includes 31 aƩributes, which are a combinaƟon of numerical and categorical features,
including Ɵme, amount, and anonymized features V1 to V28.

Problem DescripƟon:
The problem to be addressed in this project is to develop a predicƟve model that can accurately detect
fraudulent credit card transacƟons. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can idenƟfy
fraudulent transacƟons in real-Ɵme, helping financial insƟtuƟons to prevent potenƟal financial losses
and protect their customers from fraud.

Data Mining Approach:
The primary data mining approach for this project will be classificaƟon learning. The goal is to build a
classificaƟon model that can accurately classify transacƟons as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on
the features in the dataset. ClassificaƟon algorithms such as logisƟc regression, decision trees, and
support vector machines will be considered for this task. In addiƟon, numeric esƟmaƟon techniques
such as anomaly detecƟon methods may also be explored as a secondary approach to detect unusual
paƩerns or outliers in the data.

Data TransformaƟon:
Before performing data mining, some transformaƟons will be needed on the dataset. This may include
handling missing values, scaling the numerical features, and potenƟally reducing the dimensionality of
the dataset using feature selecƟon or feature extracƟon techniques. AddiƟonally, since the dataset is
imbalanced with a low number of fraud cases, appropriate techniques such as oversampling,
undersampling, or SMOTE (SyntheƟc Minority Over-sampling Technique) may be applied to balance the
dataset and prevent bias in the model.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the proposed data mining project aims to develop a predicƟve model for credit card fraud
detecƟon using classificaƟon learning and potenƟally numeric esƟmaƟon techniques. The dataset will be
obtained from Kaggle, which contains credit card transacƟon data, and will require preprocessing and
transformaƟon before applying data mining techniques. The outcome of this project will be a predicƟve
model that can accurately classify credit card transacƟons as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, providing
valuable insights for fraud detecƟon in the financial industry.
